### **6. Image Filtering System**
A menu-driven Java application that applies convolution filters to images. Users can choose from predefined or custom filters and select edge handling methods such as wrapping or padding. The program supports multiple image formats and includes debugging options to output RGB channel data for further analysis.

---

### **7. Word Cloud Generator**
A Java-based application that analyzes text to generate a word cloud image of the most frequently used words. The project is modular, featuring interfaces for text parsing, frequency mapping, and word ranking. It supports multithreading for performance optimization and accepts inputs from files, URLs, or plain text.

---

### **8. Network-Based Chat Application**
A networked chat system built using Java's Socket API, supporting real-time communication between multiple clients. Features include private messaging, user notifications, and reconnection handling. The application ensures smooth operation through multithreading and efficient resource management on both client and server sides.
